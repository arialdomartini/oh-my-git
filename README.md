# Installation
## <a name="install-the-font"></a>The Font

oh-my-git is shipped with 3 themes. The one showed above is called [oppa-lana-style](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git-themes/blob/oppa-lana-style/oppa-lana-style.zsh-theme). It's based on the [Awesome-Terminal-Fonts](https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts) by [@gabrielelana](https://github.com/gabrielelana). The screenshots above use the font [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe/Source-Code-Pro) by Adobe patched to include additional glyphs from [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) and from Awesome-Terminal-Fonts, but you can choose any other of the Awesome-Terminal-Fonts.

You can freely [download](https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts/tree/patching-strategy/patched) the fonts from the original repo.

To install one of the fonts, on OS X just double click on the corresponding ```ttf``` file and click on ```Install font```. So far, I didn't find a way to make the fallback strategy work on OS X.

On Linux you can either [install the patched font](#install-the-patched-font) or you can apply the Awesome-Terminal-Fonts [fallback strategy](https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts/blob/master/README.md#patching-vs-fallback).
    
Then, configure your terminal with the desired font, and restart it.

## Bash

One liner for OS X:

    git clone https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git.git ~/.oh-my-git && echo source ~/.oh-my-git/prompt.sh >> ~/.profile

One liner for Ubuntu:

    git clone https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git.git ~/.oh-my-git && echo source ~/.oh-my-git/prompt.sh >> ~/.bashrc

Then restart your Terminal.


## Manual installation

Fork the repo and git clone it in your home directory.

Then add

    source $HOME/oh-my-git/prompt.sh

to the bash startup file (`~/.profile` on Mac, `~/.bashrc` on Linux)

If you prefer to keep oh-my-git repository in a different directory, just modify the startup file accordingly to the chosen position

    source /wherever-you-want/oh-my-git/prompt.sh

## zsh

With antigen installed, just add

    antigen-use oh-my-zsh
    antigen-bundle arialdomartini/oh-my-git
    antigen theme arialdomartini/oh-my-git-themes oppa-lana-style

to your `.zshrc` file.

[`oh-my-git-themes`](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git-themes) still includes the old 2 themes [arialdo-granzestyle](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git-themes/blob/master/arialdo-granzestyle.zsh-theme)  (which is inspired to the great [Granze theme](https://github.com/Granze/G-zsh-theme-2)) by [@granze](https://github.com/granze), and [arialdo-pathinline](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git-themes/blob/master/arialdo-pathinline.zsh-theme). If you want to use them, edit accordingly your ```.zshrc``` file.

## How to install antigen

[antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) is a plugin manager for `zsh`.
Installing antigen is straightforward:

    cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen.git .antigen 

Then, edit your `.zshrc` file including

    source "$HOME/.antigen/antigen.zsh"

    antigen-use oh-my-zsh
    antigen-bundle arialdomartini/oh-my-git
    antigen theme arialdomartini/oh-my-git-themes oppa-lana-style

    antigen-apply

When you restart zsh, antigen will download and install all that's needed.

# Customizing symbols

You can easily change any symbols used by the prompt. Take a look to the file [prompt.sh](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git/blob/master/prompt.sh) (or to [oppa-lana-style.zsh-theme](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git-themes/blob/master/oppa-lana-style.zsh-theme) if you use zsh). You will find a bunch of variables, each of them with its default value. The variables names should be auto-explanatory. Something like

```
: ${omg_is_a_git_repo_symbol:='❤'}
: ${omg_has_untracked_files_symbol:='∿'}
: ${omg_has_adds_symbol:='+'}
: ${omg_has_deletions_symbol:='-'}
: ${omg_has_cached_deletions_symbol:='✖'}
: ${omg_has_modifications_symbol:='✎'}
: ${omg_has_cached_modifications_symbol:='☲'}
: ${omg_ready_to_commit_symbol:='→'}
: ${omg_is_on_a_tag_symbol:='⌫'}
```

You can override any of those variables in your shell startup file.

For example, just add a

```
omg_is_on_a_tag_symbol='#'
```

to your `.bashrc` file, and oh-my-git will use `#` when you are on a tag.


# Disabling oh-my-git
oh-my-git can be disabled on a per-repository basis. Just add a

    [oh-my-git]
    enabled = false

in the `.git/config` file of a repo to revert to the original prompt for that particular repo. This could be handy when working with very huge repository, when the git commands invoked by oh-my-git can slow down the prompt.

# Uninstall

## Bash
* Remove the line `source ~/.oh-my-git/prompt.sh` from the terminal boot script (`.profile` or `.bash_rc`)
* Delete the oh-my-git repo with a `rm -fr ~/.oh-my-git`

## zsh
Remove the lines

```
antigen-use oh-my-zsh
antigen-bundle arialdomartini/oh-my-git
antigen theme arialdomartini/oh-my-git-themes oppa-lana-style
```

from your `.zshrc` file

# Troubleshooting

#### Help, I installed oh-my-git but this is what I see:


![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git-gh-pages/master/images/samples/bad-font.png)

**A**: It's likely that you forgot to [install the font](#install-the-font).

---

#### I don't want to install a new font!

**A**: "No prob. You may select [another theme](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git-themes), or you can customize symbols. Take a look to the [prompt.sh](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git/blob/master/prompt.sh) file. It contains a list of pre-defined symbols, similar to:

    # Symbols
    : ${omg_is_a_git_repo_symbol:='❤'}
    : ${omg_has_untracked_files_symbol:='∿'}
    : ${omg_has_adds_symbol:='+'}
    : ${omg_has_deletions_symbol:='-'}
    : ${omg_has_modifications_symbol:='✎'}

Those are just default values. If you wish to use another glyph for untracked file, just define a

    omg_has_untracked_files_symbol="whatever"

in your shell startup file.

---

#### On OS X, I configured iTerm2 with the patched font, but the prompt is still broken.

**A**: iTerm2 preferences have 2 sections for setting the font: one for `Regular Font` and one for `Non-ASCII Font`.
The font should be set on both the sections, like showed in the following screenshot:

![iTerm2 Preferences Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git-gh-pages/master/images/samples/iterm2.png)

---

#### <a name="install-the-patched-font"></a>Help! On Linux I can't install the font!

**A**: You should refer to the documentation of [Awesome-Terminal-Fonts](https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts). Anyway, this is how I personally setup the prompt on Ubuntu

    # Copy the awesome fonts to ~/.fonts
    cd /tmp
    git clone http://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts
    cd awesome-terminal-fonts
    git checkout patching-strategy
    mkdir -p ~/.fonts
    cp patched/*.ttf ~/.fonts

    # update the font-info cache
    sudo fc-cache -fv ~/.fonts

Then, run ```gnome-terminal``` (or whatever terminal you like) and select one of the awesome-fonts

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git-gh-pages/master/images/samples/gnome-terminal.png)

Finally, install oh-my-zsh with the one-liner (if you use Bash) or with Antigen if you love zsh, and restart the Terminal.

---

#### When I'm not in a git repo, I want to use my old, beloved prompt...

**A**: Sure! Use the variable `omg_ungit_prompt`. Store there your old prompt: it will be used when you are not in a git repo.

---

#### Help! I used the one-liner for OS X, but the prompt doesn't start!

**A**: The one-liner for OS X adds the startup command in ```~/.profile```, which is the startup file for generic login shells. If a ```~/.bash_profile``` is present, this is used in place of ```.profile```, and ```.profile``` itself is ignored. To solve your issue, use this alternative one-liner

    cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git.git && echo source $HOME/oh-my-git/prompt.sh >> .bash_profile

or just move the startup command

    echo source $HOME/oh-my-git/prompt.sh

from ```.profile``` to ```.bash_profile```

---

#### Hey, where's my current virtualenv name? It disappeared from the prompt! Or it appears like this

![virtualenv badly rendered](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/150719/5852434/06933e88-a217-11e4-81a0-153c5a300b0a.png)

**A**: Yes, actually the virtualenv's approach with prompts is pretty disappointing (see [Virtualenv's bin/activate is Doing It Wrong](https://gist.github.com/datagrok/2199506)): in fact, the script ```activate``` performs a

```
PS1="(`basename \"$VIRTUAL_ENV\"`)$PS1"
```

that arrogantly prepends the virtualenv name to the current ```PS1```, leaving you no opportunity to customise the output.

You can solve this problem disabling the standart virtualenv prompt injection and using the callback function `omg_prompt_callback`.

Add

```
VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT=true
function omg_prompt_callback() {
    if [ -n "${VIRTUAL_ENV}" ]; then
        echo "\e[0;31m(`basename ${VIRTUAL_ENV}`)\e[0m "
    fi
}
```

to your shell startup script. It should render the prompt inside an active virtualenv like this

![a proper virtualenv rendering](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/150719/5852429/e50d18a6-a216-11e4-9b0e-c902f47a1ca4.png)]

You can use the call back function to inject whatever you want at the beginning of the second line.

# Known bugs and limitations

* git v1.8.4 or newer is required
* It works weird on brand new repositories, before the first commit
* It has been tested on Mac and Ubuntu only. I never managed to make it work on Cygwin
* Depending on the theme selected, you need an unicode font (like Sauce Code Pro, Menlo or Monaco on Mac OS X, or Monospace on Ubuntu; on Windows, with Cygwin, a good choice is [Meslo](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font) by [André Berg](https://github.com/andreberg), but I didn't tested the ooppa-lana-style theme)
* If the Terminal uses a clear background color, in Bash you need to change the colors defined in [prompt.sh](https://github.com/arialdomartini/oh-my-git/blob/oppa-lana-style/prompt.sh). The zsh version is not affected by this problem.
